# Library
Just started working with classes &amp; objects in Java and this is my 1st attempt at understanding the concepts
My idea is that the main class is will just have a prompt and that prompt will direct the program to the methods that I've written in the various different classes. As of today I don't have any idea of how to do that but, this is just a first attempt at creating objects and then using them.
